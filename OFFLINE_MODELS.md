# Offline Model Pre-downloading Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to enable offline model execution in the Docker container.

## Problem
The original pipeline downloaded models at runtime, which requires internet access. When running with `--network none`, the container would fail because it couldn't download:
- TinyLlama GGUF model from HuggingFace Hub
- Sentence Transformer model
- NLTK punkt tokenizer data

## Solution
Pre-download all models during Docker build phase when internet is available.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **`download_models.py`** - Script that pre-downloads all required models
   - Downloads TinyLlama 1.1B GGUF model (~637MB)
   - Downloads sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~80MB)  
   - Downloads NLTK punkt tokenizer data
   - Verifies all models work correctly

2. **`verify_offline.py`** - Verification script to test offline capability
   - Tests NLTK data availability
   - Tests Sentence Transformer model loading
   - Tests LLM model loading
   - Can be run inside container to verify offline operation

### Modified Files:

1. **`Dockerfile`** - Updated to pre-download models
   ```dockerfile
   # Copy the model download script
   COPY download_models.py .
   
   # Pre-download all models and data during build (requires internet)
   RUN python download_models.py
   ```

2. **`pipeline.py`** - Fixed input directory path and UTF-8 handling
   - Changed from hardcoded `input/Collection_3/PDFs` to flexible `input/`
   - Added UTF-8 environment variables to subprocess calls

3. **`README.md`** - Updated documentation
   - Added build requirements and timings
   - Explained model pre-downloading process
   - Clarified offline execution capability

4. **`build_and_test.sh/bat`** - Updated build scripts
   - Added notes about model downloading during build
   - Clarified internet requirements

5. **`test_docker.py`** - Enhanced testing
   - Added offline verification test
   - Tests container with `--network none`

## Models Downloaded

| Model | Size | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 (GGUF) | ~637MB | LLM query enhancement |
| all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | ~80MB | Text embeddings |
| NLTK punkt | ~13MB | Text tokenization |

## Build Process

1. **Build Phase** (requires internet):
   ```bash
   docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t document-processor:v1.0 .
   ```
   - Downloads and caches all models
   - Verifies models work
   - Build time: 5-15 minutes

2. **Run Phase** (offline):
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/input:/app/input -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output --network none document-processor:v1.0
   ```
   - Uses pre-cached models
   - No internet access required
   - Full offline operation

## Verification

To verify offline capability:
```bash
docker run --rm --network none document-processor:v1.0 python verify_offline.py
```

This tests all models without internet access and confirms the container is ready for offline processing.

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Container runs with `--network none`
2. **Reliability**: No dependency on internet during execution
3. **Performance**: No download delays at runtime
4. **Reproducibility**: Same models every time, no version drift
